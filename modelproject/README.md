# Modelproject

Our project is titled *Model Project by VEM*. In the project, we solve three variations of the Solow Model:

i)   The General Solow Model,

ii)  The General Solow Model with Land,

iii) The Solow Model with Human Capital.

We solve for steady state in each of the models. This is done symbolic and numerical. Furthermore, we plot all of the relevant phase diagrams with interactive sliders for each of the models' parameters.

The results of the project can be seen from running Modelproject.ipynb.

Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
