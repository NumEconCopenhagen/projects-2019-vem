# Dataproject

Our project is titled *Data Project by VEM*. In the project, we fetch and adjust quarterly GDP data for Denmark in the period 1990-2018 and present it both visually and interactively with the help of a moving average-slider.

The results of the project can be seen from running Dataproject.ipynb.

This loades one dataset:

*NKN1.xlsx* downloaded from www.statistikbanken.dk/NKN1

Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst
