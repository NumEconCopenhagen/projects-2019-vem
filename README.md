# Welcome to the repository of VEM

This repository contains:

* [/dataproject](/dataproject): In this project, we fetch and adjust quarterly GDP data for Denmark in the period 1990-2018 and present it both visually and interactively with the help of a moving average-slider.
* [/examproject](/examproject): The examproject-notebook consists of our answers to three problems pertaining to:
   - Human capital and labour supply
   - Simulation of the AS-AD model
   - Exchange economy
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): In this project, we solve three variations of the Solow Model:
   i) The General Solow Model,
   ii) The General Solow Model with Land,
   iii) The Solow Model with Human Capital.
We solve for steady state in each of the models. This is done symbolic and numerical. Furthermore, we plot all of the relevant phase diagrams with interactive sliders for each of the models' parameters.
